        <p>This project was inspired by a long-standing personal interest—I've always wanted to build a robotic butler. The design prioritizes lightweight construction, concentrating most of the mass in the torso and pelvis to improve balance and efficiency. Structural components are fabricated using 3D printing, while the skeleton and support frames utilize laser-cut carbon fiber tubes and plates for strength and rigidity.

To minimize size and weight, the actuators are based on axial flux BLDC motors. The drivetrain uses 3D-printed cycloidal reducers, incorporating standard industrial components—such as screws, metal pins, and bearings—to keep costs low.

Currently, version 0.0.1 of the lower-body bipedal design is shown in the image. I'm in the process of converting the model into an MJCF (MuJoCo XML) file for simulation and training it to walk using reinforcement learning.</p>
