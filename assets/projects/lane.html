                        This project was motivated by the challenge of multi-lane detection in the absence of high-definition maps, particularly in complex or unstructured road environments.

To address this, I proposed a pixel-level lane association framework by computing a pixel-to-pixel relational matrix that captures the structural continuity of individual lane markers. This approach enables the system to differentiate between adjacent lane boundaries and maintain consistent lane identities across frames.

To improve efficiency, a lane marker filtering module was introduced to eliminate irrelevant pixels early in the pipeline, significantly reducing computational overhead while maintaining detection accuracy.

This method supports lane-level localization using only onboard perception, making it especially suitable for real-time autonomous driving applications in environments where HD maps are unavailable or unreliable.
