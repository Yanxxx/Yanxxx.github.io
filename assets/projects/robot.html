                This is my Ph.D. defense project, motivated by the goal of enabling non-experts to teach robots new task skills. 
                The main challenges addressed include limited task demonstrations, unstructured environments,
                    and the absence of expert-defined goal states.
            </p>
            <p>
                To tackle these issues, I developed:
                <ul>
                    <li>A task demonstration evaluation method to refine human demonstrations and robot-collected execution episodes.</li>
                    <li>A hierarchical reinforcement learning framework for trajectory planning and action generation.</li>
                    <li>A latent space exploration network to reduce the high-dimensional image state space and accelerate policy learning.
                </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
