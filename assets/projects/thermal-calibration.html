                            This project serves as a foundational step for thermal-RGB vehicle detection, focusing on the cross-modality target association between RGB and thermal cameras. The goal is to accurately match detected objects across both sensing modalities, a critical requirement for robust sensor fusion.

The central challenge lies in identifying a common calibration marker that is reliably detectable in both RGB and thermal imagery. To address this, I designed a custom LED-based calibration board. The LEDs emit visible light, which can be captured by the RGB camera, and generate enough heat signature to be detected by the thermal camera.

Unlike traditional camera calibration techniques that rely on corner features or checkerboard patterns, LEDs do not produce high-contrast geometric features. To enhance marker localization, we proposed a Gaussian-based light and temperature distribution model for precise center estimation of each LED in both modalities.

This approach enables accurate spatial alignment between RGB and thermal images, laying the groundwork for more advanced multi-sensor detection systems in autonomous driving.
