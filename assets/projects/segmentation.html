                This project extends the previous lane detection work by improving the efficiency of lane instance association. The original approach relied on explicit computation of a pixel-level correlation matrix, which proved computationally expensive and difficult to scale.

To address this, we replaced the exact correlation computation with a fully convolutional neural network (CNN) module that learns to estimate the correlation matrix directly from image features. This data-driven approach significantly reduces computational cost while retaining the ability to distinguish individual lane instances.

The predicted correlation matrix is then used to perform lane instance separation, allowing the system to robustly identify and track multiple lanes in real-time, even in complex road scenarios.
