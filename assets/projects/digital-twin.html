                To support demonstration data collection, I developed a teleoperated digital twin system for a collaborative 
                robot (cobot), designed specifically for simulated excavator tasks. Due to hardware limitations, we utilized an 
                HTC VIVE controller as the primary input device to capture human motion signals. The system was built on ROS, 
                using the tracked controller pose as the control input.

                To address the challenge of position revisiting—a common issue when using absolute position inputs—I implemented 
                a differential input model. The system only registers displacement when the controller trigger is pressed, 
                allowing for smoother and more intuitive control.

                A significant challenge arose from kinematic singularities caused by joint constraints in the reduced-DoF 
                excavator model, particularly with the final two joints fixed at (0°, 90°). To overcome this, 
                I introduced a displacement repositioning strategy that mitigates singularities and ensures stable 
                teleoperation performance.

                This system greatly streamlines human demonstration collection for downstream learning algorithms in 
                robotic excavation tasks.
