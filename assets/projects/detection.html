                This project was motivated by the challenges of vehicle perception under severe lighting conditionsâ€”a critical safety concern in real-world driving scenarios such as driving directly into sunlight at dawn or dusk, navigating rainy nights with inconsistent street lighting, or operating in low-light environments.

To address these issues, we developed a complementary detection system that fuses data from an RGB camera and a far-infrared thermal camera. These two sensing modalities are highly complementary: the RGB camera excels under good lighting, while the thermal camera provides consistent object detection in low-visibility or high-glare situations.

Our approach effectively covers a wide range of conditions:

Overexposed environments where visible light is too intense,

Underexposed or nighttime scenes where RGB performance drops,

Thermal-uniform environments, such as sheltered or foggy areas where background and vehicle temperatures converge.

By jointly processing RGB and thermal data, the system significantly improves vehicle detection robustness across diverse and adverse lighting conditions, enhancing safety and reliability for autonomous and assisted driving.
