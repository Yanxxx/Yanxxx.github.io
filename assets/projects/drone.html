                    <p>This drone project was initiated in response to DJI's recent product restrictions and bans. 
                        Our original plan was to use DJI drones for remote monitoring, but the increasing uncertainty around their 
                        availability and operability led us to develop our own drone platform to ensure continued access to aerial 
                        capabilities.

                        The initial design targets included:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                A payload capacity of 40 kg 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                A maximum range of 30 km with full load
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                15 km radio control range 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                10 km local telemetry range 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                A reserved 5G telemetry interface for future upgrades
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>                        
                    <p>
                        To enhance autonomous operation, we integrated learning-based algorithms for path planning and targeted route optimization. Additionally, we developed a vision-language model to improve human-drone interaction, enabling more intuitive and effective control through natural language commands.
