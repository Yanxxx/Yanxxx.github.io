        <p>
            This project is a simulation study for my 3D-printed humanoid robot. 
            Building a robot from scratch is a non-trivial task, so I began by developing a simulation environment
            leveraging the humanoid model from the Unitree G1 as a reference. 
            The primary goal is to gain hands-on experience with reinforcement learning algorithms for humanoid locomotion training,
             with the long-term objective of exploring model transfer techniques across robots of different sizes.
