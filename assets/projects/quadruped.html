        <p>This project was a collaborative research effort focused on dementia patient care. 
            My role was to develop algorithms enabling a robotic dog to recognize individuals, 
            follow them, and provide timely reminders to help patients avoid missed or duplicate medication doses.

            To enhance patient interaction, I integrated the LLaMA-2-7B language model and fine-tuned it using LoRA 
            for generating personalized daily schedules and activity logs. Additionally, I fine-tuned CLIP-L/14 to 
            improve visual recognition of medications, ensuring reliable monitoring and support in the patient's daily 
            routine.
