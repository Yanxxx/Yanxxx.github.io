        <p>The southeastern US forestry industry plants 1.5 billion seedlings annually, generating over $300 billion in
            economic activity. However, climate volatility has increased first-year seedling mortality by 15-20%, resulting in
            $500 million annual losses. Current inventory methods rely on labor-intensive manual counting and visual
            health assessments that detect problems only after symptoms appearâ€”too late for effective intervention.

        <p>Innovation & Technology
            ResilientSeedling develops an integrated AI-powered platform combining:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Hyperspectral UAV sensing capturing hundreds of spectral bands vs. traditional 4-5 band multispectral imaging.
            </li>
            <li>
                Laboratory-validated stress signature library identifying unique spectral responses for drought and freeze damage 8-10 days before visual symptoms.
            </li>
            <li>
                Deep learning algorithms achieving >90% accuracy in preliminary testing for stress detection and classification.
            </li>
            <li>
                Automated seedling inventory replacing manual counting with computer vision-based enumeration.
            </li>
        </ul>

Our breakthrough approach creates controlled laboratory stress conditions to develop reference spectral
signatures, then uses pattern-matching AI to detect these signatures in field conditions via drone-mounted
hyperspectral cameras.</p>
