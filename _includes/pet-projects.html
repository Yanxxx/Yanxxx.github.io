                    <p>As a senior mechanical engineer currently working at J&J, I am mainly responsible for hardware system design on the <strong>Monarch Surgical Platform</strong>, the first robotic platform for minimally invasive diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in the lungs and kidneys.</p>
                    <p>I work on many projects related to the robotic arm and instrument manipulator, both on the hardware and software front.</p>

                    <p>This paper proposes a method to measure the motion of a moving rigid body using a hybrid visualâ€“inertial sensor. The rotational velocity of the moving object is computed from visual optical flow by solving a depthindependent bilinear constraint, and the translational velocity of the moving object is estimated by solving a dynamics constraint that reveals the relation between scene depth and translational motion. By fusing an inertial sensor, the scale of translational velocities can be estimated, which is otherwise unrecoverable from monocular visual optical flow. An iterative refinement scheme is introduced to deal with observation noise and outliers, and the extended Kalman filter is applied for motion tracking. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by simulation studies and practical experiments, and the results show the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of accuracy and robustness. </p>
